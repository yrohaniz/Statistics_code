# Statistics_code
This code implements basic statistical analysis on the output of the cellulolytic biofilm simulation.
This code is used to calculate some of the statistics of the output data from the 2d simulations of cellulolytic biofilms. 
These statistics include the sample mean, the sample standard deviation and the standard error of the sample mean.
